Creating a daily planner to help me track my events throughout my working day. My planner will cover from 9-5 in hourly blocks. I will be able to create events that will save when I close the page. I will also be able to delete events as I complete them.

Instructions for use!
- hour blocks for normal 9-5 working day
  - hour blocks will appear green if the current time permits or red if that time has already passed
      - you have to refresh the page to update the clock
- simply write down an event within the hour block it falls in
- once you've put down your event click the 'Save' button on the right hand side
  - this will save your events within the input field to your local storage
  - you can now close the event planner
- once you reopen the event planner simply click the 'Load Events' button
  - this will load all your saved events from your local storage
- once an event has been completed just delete the text within the input field
  - click the 'Save' button once the text is deleted to update your local storage
- now upon refreshing the page and clicking the 'Load Events' button your finished event will no longer appear

Have fun and enjoy!
